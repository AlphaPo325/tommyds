/** \file
 * Open addressing hashtable.
 *
 * This hashtable resizes dynamically. It starts with the minimal size of 16 buckets, it doubles
 * the size then it reaches a load factor greater than 0.5 and it halves the size with a load
 * factor lower than 0.125.
 *
 * All the elements are reallocated in a single resize operation done inside
 * tommy_hashopen_insert() or tommy_hashopen_remove().
 *
 * Note that the resize operation takes approximatively 100 [ms] with 1 million of elements,
 * and 1 [second] with 10 millions. This could be a problem in real-time applications.
 *
 * The resize also fragment the heap, as it involves allocating a double-sized table, copy elements,
 * and deallocating the older table. Leaving a big hole in the heap.
 *
 * The ::tommy_hashlin hashtable fixes both problems.
 *
 * To initialize the hashtable you have to call tommy_hashopen_init().
 *
 * \code
 * tommy_hashslin hashopen;
 *
 * tommy_hashopen_init(&hashopen);
 * \endcode
 *
 * To insert elements in the hashtable you have to call tommy_hashopen_insert() for
 * each element.
 * In the insertion call you have to specify the address of the node, the
 * address of the object, and the hash value of the key to use.
 * The address of the object is used to initialize the tommy_node::data field
 * of the node, and the hash to initialize the tommy_node::key field.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object {
 *     tommy_node node;
 *     // other fields
 *     int value;
 * };
 *
 * struct object* obj = malloc(sizeof(struct object)); // creates the object
 *
 * obj->value = ...; // initializes the object
 *
 * tommy_hashopen_insert(&hashopen, &obj->node, obj, tommy_inthash_u32(obj->value)); // inserts the object
 * \endcode
 *
 * To find and element in the hashtable you have to call tommy_hashtable_search()
 * providing a comparison function, its argument, and the hash of the key to search.
 *
 * \code
 * int compare(const void* arg, const void* obj)
 * {
 *     return (*(const unsigned*)arg != ((const struct object*)obj)->value;
 * }
 *
 * struct object* obj = tommy_hashopen_search(&hashopen, compare, &value_to_find, tommy_inthash_u32(value_to_find));
 * if (!obj) {
 *     // not found
 * } else {
 *     // found
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To iterate over all the elements in the hashtable with the same key, you have to
 * use tommy_hashopen_bucket() and follow the tommy_node::next pointer until NULL.
 * You have also to check explicitely for the key, as the bucket may contains
 * different keys.
 *
 * \code
 * tommy_node* i = tommy_hashopen_bucket(&hashopen, tommy_inthash_u32(value_to_find));
 * while (i) {
 *     struct object* obj = i->data; // gets the object pointer
 *
 *     if (obj->value == value_to_find) {
 *         printf("%d\n", obj->value); // process the object
 *     }
 *
 *     i = i->next; // goes to the next element
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To remove an element from the hashtable you have to call tommy_hashopen_remove()
 * providing a comparison function, its argument, and the hash of the key to search
 * and remove.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_remove(&hashtable, compare, &value_to_remove, tommy_inthash_u32(value_to_remove));
 * if (obj) {
 *     free(obj); // frees the object allocated memory
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To destroy the hashtable you have to remove all the elements, and deinitialize
 * the hashtable calling tommy_hashopen_done().
 *
 * \code
 * tommy_hashopen_done(&hashopen);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that you cannot iterates over all the elements in the hashtable using the
 * hashtable itself. You have to insert all the elements also in a ::tommy_list,
 * and use the list to iterate. See the \ref multiindex example for more detail.
